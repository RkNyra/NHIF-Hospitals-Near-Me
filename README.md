### Setup/Installation Requirements
* Github and Heroku account - from where the application can be cloned or downloaded

### Behavior Driven Development
#### A user is able to:
1. see what the app is all about and see instructions on how to use the app while they're on the landing page
2. navigate to the 'Find a Hospital' page to search for NHIF-registered hospitals
3. view hospital reviews given by other users per specific hospitals on the 'Hospital Review' page
4. give hospital reviews/share their experience at the hospital they visited (registered users)
5. view their profile: this has their name, a friendly/client message and the log-out link (for registered users only)
